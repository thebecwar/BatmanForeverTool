# Batman Forever Tool

This is a plugin for [BizHawk](https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk) that should (hopefully) make creating Tool-Assisted Speedruns of Batman Forever on the SNES easier.

If you just want to try it, check the releases tab for a download with the DLL. Extract it and place it into the `ExternalTools` directory. You will also need a copy of the game.

Currently requires Visual Studio 2015 to compile. YMMV.
